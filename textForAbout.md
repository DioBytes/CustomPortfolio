Growing up in my dad’s pizza place, I was surrounded by the tantalizing aromas of fresh dough and melted cheese and the vibrant energy of a bustling kitchen. My father was a true mentor during those adolescent years, teaching me the value of hard work and the importance of passion in everything I do. With every slice of pizza, I absorbed the entrepreneurial spirit that defined my father’s world.<br><br>

As I entered college and began studying computer information systems, I couldn’t shake off the lessons I had learned in that humble kitchen. I realized that the same values of respect and love that held a team of chefs together could be applied to the ever-evolving world of technology. The more I delved into artificial intelligence, UI/UX development, and web design, the more I saw parallels between the coordination and execution of a well-run kitchen and the seamless function of intricate tech systems.<br><br>

I learned that no matter your path, your obstacles are made of the same stuff. The passion, determination, and resilience needed to run a marathon are the same qualities that can propel you to land on the moon. Likewise, my appetite for success in tech was fueled by the same love for cooking and eating good food that my father instilled in me.<br><br>

Now, as an IT student assistant at the University of Louisville’s President’s Office, I carry those invaluable lessons with me every day. I constantly push myself to learn new things, explore consciousness, and live passionately. I aim to help others help themselves, sharing the wisdom I’ve gained from overcoming life’s challenges.<br><br>

In my free time, you can find me staying active, whipping up a storm in the kitchen, or creating new things to continue my journey of helping people better their lives.<br><br>

So, welcome to my “about me” page. I’m Dylan, a pizza-loving, tech-savvy, passionate individual, always ready to share my story and learn from yours. Whether you’re here to collaborate, learn, or just say hello, I’m glad our paths have crossed. Let’s do something great together.
