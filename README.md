## About Me

Hello there! I'm Dylan, a tech enthusiast who started from making pizzas near Chicago, learning the value of hard work and passion. These formative experiences in a bustling kitchen have shaped my journey in technology, especially in AI, UI/UX design, and web development. At the University of Louisville’s President’s Office, I bring these values into my role as an IT student assistant, continually exploring new ideas and living passionately.

Off-duty, I'm an active cook and creator, always ready to collaborate and share stories. My interests in philosophy, religion, and the mysteries of life mirror my approach to programming - a journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Let's make something great together!

## Projects

AI Text Summarize App
This project was a journey in integrating unfamiliar APIs, particularly the Hugging Face Inference API. The challenge was learning how to integrate these new elements effectively. By engaging with the Hugging Face community and embracing collaboration, I overcame these hurdles, exemplifying my philosophy of 'from pizzas to pixels' in action.

Technologies Used: Node.js, Express, Hugging Face Inference API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Skills

I pride myself on my critical thinking and effective communication skills, always questioning the status quo to refine processes. This approach, coupled with my technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and Rest APIs, enables me to create innovative and efficient solutions.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
