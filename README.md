TODO:
Github pages is a static-served hosting platform, that means no server side processes ie. contact.php

Lets get the about text added along with removing the contact form, find another way to plug contact info
can link to vettras form instead, which would really help engagement and tie everything together

finish another project, then get them up on github pages, then link them to the portfolio buttons. They'll probably just externally redirect
