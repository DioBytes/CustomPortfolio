## About Me

Hello there! I'm Dylan, a tech enthusiast who started from making pizzas near Chicago, learning the value of hard work and passion. These formative experiences in a bustling kitchen have shaped my journey in technology, especially in AI, UI/UX design, and web development. At the University of Louisville’s President’s Office, I bring these values into my role as an IT student assistant, continually exploring new ideas and living passionately.

Off-duty, I'm an active cook and creator, always ready to collaborate and share stories. My interests in philosophy, religion, and the mysteries of life mirror my approach to programming - a journey from ignorance to enlightenment. Let's make something great together!
