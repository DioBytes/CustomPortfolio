              Growing up in the bustling atmosphere of a family-run pizza
              kitchen, I was immersed in a world where precision, creativity,
              and teamwork were paramount. Majoring in Computer Information
              Systems, I discovered how these principles could be applied to
              technology.

              I learned that no matter your path, your obstacles are made of the
              same stuff. The passion, determination, and resilience needed to
